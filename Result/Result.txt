Result: This code is written in C and uses the following libraries:

1. OpenSSL: This is a cryptographic library that provides a wide range of cryptographic functions, including encryption, decryption, signing, and verification.
2. Bio: This is a library that provides a way to handle binary data in a text-based format.
3. Opt: This is a library that provides a way to handle command-line options and arguments.
4. App: This is a library that provides a way to handle application-specific functions and data.

The code also uses several OpenSSL-specific functions and data structures, including:

1. OSSL_STORE_CTX: This is a context object that is used to manage the loading of store objects.
2. OSSL_STORE_INFO: This is a structure that represents a single store object.
3. OSSL_STORE_OPEN: This is a function that opens a store object.
4. OSSL_STORE_LOAD: This is a function that loads a store object from a file or URI.
5. OSSL_STORE_EOF: This is a function that checks if the end of the store object has been reached.
6. OSSL_STORE_ERROR: This is a function that checks if an error occurred while loading the store object.
7. OSSL_STORE_CLOSE: This is a function that closes a store object.

The code also uses several other OpenSSL-specific functions and data structures, including:

1. EVP_MD: This is a structure that represents a message digest algorithm.
2. EVP_PKEY: This is a structure that represents a public or private key.
3. X509: This is a structure that represents an X.509 certificate.
4. X509_CRL: This is a structure that represents an X.509 certificate revocation list.
5. ASN1_INTEGER: This is a structure that represents an ASN.1 integer.
6. X509_NAME: This is a structure that represents an X.509 name.
7. MBSTRING_UTF8: This is a constant that represents the UTF-8 encoding of a string.

Overall, the code is written in C and uses the OpenSSL library to perform various cryptographic functions.
